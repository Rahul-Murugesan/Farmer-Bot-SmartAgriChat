## Farmer-Bot-SmartAgriChat
This chatbot uses LangChain, Google Palm LLM, and SQLDatabaseChain to answer farmer queries from an agricultural database containing temperature, humidity, soil moisture, weather, crop health, and irrigation status. It enhances accuracy using semantic similarity with Chroma vector store and few-shot prompt templates for contextual SQL generation

## Project Highlights
SmartAgriBot is an AI-powered assistant for farmers and agricultural managers to query real-time field data.

The system uses a MySQL database to store sensor-based data such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, weather prediction, crop health, and irrigation status.

We will build an LLM-based question-answering system using the following components:

Google Palm LLM

Hugging Face Embeddings

Streamlit for UI

LangChain Framework

ChromaDB as a Vector Store

Few-shot Learning with Semantic Similarity Selector

In the UI, farmers can ask questions in natural language, and the system will intelligently respond with accurate field insights.
